Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and effective treatment. One of the most advanced and widely used diagnostic tools in cardiology is the Cardiac CT scan. At Butler Medical Imaging, we provide the best Cardiac CT scan service in Perth, combining cutting-edge technology with compassionate, expert care.
In this article, we’ll explore the main applications of CT scans in cardiology and why choosing a trusted provider like Butler Medical Imaging can make all the difference in your heart health journey.
What is a Cardiac CT Scan?
A Cardiac CT (Computed Tomography) scan is a non-invasive imaging test that creates detailed pictures of the heart and its blood vessels using X-ray technology. Unlike traditional X-rays, CT scans take multiple cross-sectional images that are assembled to produce high-resolution 3D visuals of the heart. These scans allow healthcare providers to assess the structure, function, and health of the heart in great detail.
Key Applications of Cardiac CT Scans in Cardiology
1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Detection
One of the most common applications of cardiac CT is identifying coronary artery disease, a condition where the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. A CT Coronary Angiogram (CTCA) is especially valuable here, as it allows doctors to view coronary arteries and detect plaque buildup or blockages that may lead to a heart attack.
When it’s used:
•	Patients with chest pain or shortness of breath
•	Those with borderline or uncertain stress test results
•	People with a strong family history of heart disease
2. Calcium Scoring
A coronary calcium score CT scan measures the amount of calcium in the coronary arteries. Calcium deposits are a marker of atherosclerosis, which can increase the risk of heart attacks. The higher the score, the greater the risk. This scan is quick, painless, and involves no contrast dye.
Ideal for:
•	Asymptomatic individuals at intermediate risk of heart disease
•	Individuals over 40 with risk factors like high cholesterol or hypertension
3. Assessment of Congenital Heart Disease
CT imaging is especially useful in evaluating congenital heart conditions, particularly in adults who were born with heart defects. CT scans provide detailed anatomical images that help doctors plan surgeries or interventions.
Commonly assessed issues include:
•	Septal defects (holes in the heart)
•	Abnormal connections between blood vessels
•	Structural abnormalities of the heart
4. Preoperative Planning for Cardiac Surgery
For patients undergoing procedures such as coronary bypass surgery, valve replacement, or heart transplants, cardiac CT provides a comprehensive view of the heart's structure. It helps surgeons understand the patient's anatomy and plan safer, more effective surgeries.
5. Evaluation of Cardiac Masses and Tumours
Though rare, masses or tumours may form in or around the heart. Cardiac CT scans offer clear imaging of these abnormalities, enabling healthcare providers to distinguish between benign and malignant growths and decide on the next steps—whether monitoring, biopsy, or surgical removal.
6. Assessment of Cardiac Function and Anatomy
Cardiac CT is an effective tool to measure ventricular function, heart wall motion, and overall heart structure. This helps in diagnosing conditions such as cardiomyopathy or heart valve disease, and determining how well the heart is pumping blood.
